# 📄 Document Chatbot – GenAI Domain Assistant with RAG & Semantic Search

**Course:** Introduction to Applied Artificial Intelligence
**Labs:** Week 9–12 (Project 3)
**Student:** Mansoor Ahmed
**Department:** BSCS
**Platform:** Python + OpenAI API + ChromaDB + Streamlit

---

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **production-ready document-aware chatbot** that answers questions based on company documents using modern **Generative AI** techniques.

The system combines:

* 🤖 OpenAI GPT models for conversational AI
* 📚 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
* 🔍 Semantic Search using Embeddings & ChromaDB
* 🌐 Streamlit-based Web Interface

Unlike traditional keyword search, the chatbot understands context and synonyms. For example:

* **"time off"** → retrieves **vacation policy**
* **"WFH"** → retrieves **remote work policy**

This enables accurate, context-aware responses grounded in organizational documents.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/document-chatbot.git
cd document-chatbot
```

### 2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment

**Windows**

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Configure API Key

Create a `.env` file:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

> ⚠️ Never commit your API key or `.env` file to GitHub.

### 5️⃣ Add Company Documents

Place text documents inside:

```text
company_docs/
```

Example:

**hr_policy.txt**

```text
Vacation Policy: Full-time employees receive 15 days of paid vacation per year.

Remote Work Policy:
Employees may work remotely up to 3 days per week with manager approval.

Parental Leave:
12 weeks of paid leave for primary caregivers.
```

---

## 🚀 Running the Application

Launch the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open your browser:

```text
http://localhost:8501
```

---

## 💡 Example Questions

Try asking:

```text
How many vacation days do I get?

Can I work from home?

What is the parental leave policy?

Tell me about health insurance.

What benefits are available for employees?
```

The chatbot retrieves relevant document chunks and generates grounded answers using RAG.
